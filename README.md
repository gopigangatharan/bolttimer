### Key Design Patterns

#### State Management
- **React Context**: Global state management for app state and settings
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated business logic and data management
- **Local State**: Component-specific state with useState and useReducer

#### Performance Optimization
- **React.memo**: Preventing unnecessary re-renders of pure components
- **useMemo**: Expensive calculations cached (statistics, chart data)
- **useCallback**: Stable function references for child components
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading for optimal bundle size

#### Data Persistence
- **localStorage**: Client-side data storage with automatic synchronization
- **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful handling of data migration
- **Error Boundaries**: Robust error handling and recovery

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

## 📱 Features Deep Dive

### Timer System
The timer system uses a sophisticated state machine pattern with the following states:
- `idle`: Ready to start a new session
- `running`: Active session in progress  
- `paused`: Session temporarily stopped
- `completed`: Session finished successfully

### Task Management
- **Smart Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars with completion percentages
- **Priority System**: Color-coded priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- **Category Organization**: Customizable task categories
- **Pomodoro Estimation**: Built-in time estimation with accuracy tracking

### Analytics Engine
The analytics system processes session data to provide:
- **Productivity Trends**: Week-over-week comparison and improvement tracking
- **Focus Quality Metrics**: Session quality scoring based on completion and interruptions
- **Peak Performance Times**: Statistical analysis of most productive hours
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions for improvement

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **High Contrast Support**: Themes optimized for visual accessibility
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **First Launch**: Set your preferred timer durations in Settings
2. **Create Tasks**: Add tasks with estimated Pomodoro counts
3. **Start Timer**: Select a task and start your first Pomodoro session
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor your productivity in the Analytics tab

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Space`: Start, pause, or resume the timer
- `Ctrl/Cmd + R`: Reset the current timer
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 1`: Start a work session
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 2`: Start a short break
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 3`: Start a long break

### Best Practices
1. **Realistic Estimates**: Start with conservative Pomodoro estimates for tasks
2. **Regular Breaks**: Don't skip breaks - they're essential for sustained productivity
3. **Review Analytics**: Check your productivity insights weekly to identify patterns
4. **Customize Settings**: Adjust timer durations based on your optimal focus periods
